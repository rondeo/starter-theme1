# Oneupweb Starter Theme

This is theme other themes are built on. For simplicity, we're not using a 
parent/child theme arrangement, but have found more utility by simply copying 
this theme as a new repo, and modifying when necessary.

**SEND PULL REQUESTS FOR ALL CHANGES**

If you are using this to start a new site, it's better to just copy the zip 
file from bitbucket rather than running a clone, and accidentally committing
your changes.

## Build

Open up package.json, change `name`, `developmentUrl`, `stagingUrl`, 
`productionUrl` to match your project and environments.

Ensure you have NPM v8 LTS or higher running on your machine.

Execute `npm install` from inside your new theme folder.

Execute `grunt` to compile the stylesheet, javascript, and icon assets once.

Execute `grunt watch` to watch the `_assets` folder for changes and recompile 
as needed.

## Documentation

BitBucket's wiki feature is terrible. Documentation is autogenerated by 
[docz](https://docz.site) and included in the `.documentation` folder# starter-theme1
